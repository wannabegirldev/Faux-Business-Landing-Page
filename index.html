      <h3>Testimonials</h3>
      <p class="one">"I have always been ambitious and reached for the stars. When I was young my parents even told me 'stop reaching for those stars, you can't get them. Don't your arms get tired? It's weird, you walk around like a zombie all night grabbing at stars, that's not how they work... they are really far away. You can't actually reach them... is there something wrong with you?' But once I found this site I proved them wrong. Now I have at least 3000 stars in my garage. I am able to reach all of them now, using science, but my garage is full. This site rocks!"-Rick the Scientist</p>
     <p class="one">"I had fallen asleep in the library and they had closed without realizing I was still there in their cushy chairs near the window. I went online and decided I wanted to be a scientist. I found this site and never looked back. I am now respected by everyone I know. I am an upstanding citizen with a beautiful wife and 83 kids. And I science all day. Thanks, this web site!" -Steve the Scientist</p>
